**Vertical Focus:**

**Customer Characteristics:**

### Market Size Estimation

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**
- US beauty industry: ~1.2M establishments
- Beauty salons & spas: ~850,000 locations
- Average employees per location: 3-5
- **TAM: 850K studios × 4 employees = 3.4M potential seats**

**Serviceable Available Market (SAM):**
- Studios actively seeking booking software: ~30% = 255K studios
- **SAM: 255K studios × 4 employees = 1M seats**

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) - Year 3:**
- Realistic capture: 1% of SAM = 2,550 studios
- **SOM: 2,550 studios × 5 avg employees = 12,750 seats**

### Competitor Analysis

|------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Vagaro** | $25-$75/month | Established, feature-rich | Complex UI, expensive for small studios |

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**1. WhatsApp API Dependency**
- **Risk**: Meta may change pricing or restrict access
- **Mitigation**: Multi-channel strategy (SMS, email fallback), monitor policy changes

**2. Multi-Tenant Data Leaks**
- **Risk**: Cross-tenant data access bugs
- **Mitigation**: Defense-in-depth (app + database RLS), extensive testing

**3. Scalability Bottlenecks**
- **Risk**: Database slowdowns at scale
- **Mitigation**: Early indexing, caching, load testing

### Business Risks

**1. Low Market Adoption**
- **Risk**: Studios slower to adopt than expected
- **Mitigation**: Pilot program with 10-20 studios, free migration services, extended trials

**2. Aggressive Competitor Response**
- **Risk**: Incumbents copy WhatsApp integration or drop prices
- **Mitigation**: Speed to market (12 weeks), continuous innovation, customer lock-in

**3. Product-Market Fit Failure**
- **Risk**: Customers don't see enough value
- **Mitigation**: 50+ interviews pre-build, beta program, rapid iteration, clear kill criteria
